Description: Contains functions to generate pre-defined summary statistics from activPAL
    events files <http:www.palt.com>.  The package also contains functions to produce informative 
    graphics that visualise physical activity behaviour and trends.  This includes
    generating graphs that align physical activity behaviour with additional time based 
    observations described by other data sets, such as sleep diaries and continuous glucose 
    monitoring data.
