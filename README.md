# activPAL R Tools

A set of functions that allow you to generate a range of pre-defined summary statistics from activPAL events files, including a breakdown of time spent in different classes of activity by custom time period and the distribution of stepping and cadence for stepping bouts of different durations. The package also supports the generation of a visual summary of different physical behaviour outcomes across multiple individuals.  

Documentation on how to use these functions are provided within the package.

A data dictionary with an explanation of the column names used in the function outputs can be found at https://kb.palt.com/categories/data_dictionary/
